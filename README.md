## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Information

This project is built as a single-page application, leveraging modern browser features to avoid a complex build toolchain.

*   **Framework**: **React v18** (using Hooks and functional components).
*   **Module Loading**: Uses native **ESM modules** loaded directly in the browser via an `importmap`. This means there's no need for a bundler like Webpack or Vite during development.
*   **Styling**: Plain **CSS** with Custom Properties (Variables) for theming and maintainability. The design is fully responsive using media queries.
*   **State Management**: Local component state is managed with `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. App-level state (like the user session, cart, and order history) is persisted across sessions using browser `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
*   **PWA Core**:
    *   **Service Worker (`sw.js`)**: Implements a "Network falling back to Cache" strategy. This ensures the app loads quickly on subsequent visits and is available offline.
    *   **Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)**: Provides the necessary metadata for the PWA, including the app name, icons, and theme colors, making it installable.

## üöÄ Running Locally

Since this project doesn't require a build step, you can run it with any simple local web server.

### Prerequisites

You will need a local web server to serve the files to your browser. If you have Node.js and npm installed, the easiest way is to use the `serve` package.

### Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository or download all the files** into a local directory on your computer.

2.  **Install `serve` (if you don't have it already):**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command.
    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    ```

3.  **Serve the project:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory (the directory containing `index.html`) in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    serve .
    ```

4.  **Open the application:**
    The server will start and give you a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your web browser to use the application.
